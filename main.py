# TODO: Ensure that this algorithm captures the ways that the news and the technicals coincide, like today
#  (9/13/2022) we saw SPY hit the bollinger moving average at the same time that inflation data was released and bounce
#  off of it negatively in response. This movement made sense with the news of high inflation AND with hitting a
#  resistance level of the bollinger moving average. This sort of phenomena happens a lot with trend divergences and
#  price reversals as well as just happening a lot in general and that needs to be captured by the model.
